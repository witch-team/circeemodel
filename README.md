# CIRCEE: The CIRCular Energy Economy model

> Bridging the gap between economic and industrial ecology concepts

CIRCEE is a stylized dynamic general equilibrium model, soft-linked to the IAM WITCH and the LIFE model, that integrates key industrial ecology aspects and householdsâ€™ low-carbon lifestyle heterogeneity.
The model framework captures the dynamic feedback loops between physical and economic systems and can assesse the trade-offs and synergies between different sustainability objectives.

A short description of the model can be find at https://wiki.circomod.eu/CIRCEE.

The source code of the model will be available here as soon as the model documentation is published (hopefully soon).
