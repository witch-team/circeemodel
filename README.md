# CIRCEE: The CIRCular Energy Economy model

> Bridging the gap between economic and industrial ecology concepts

CIRCEE is a deterministic Dynamic and Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model, soft-linked to the IAM WITCH and the LIFE model. It incorporates some industrial ecology principles to evaluate how CE strategies and enablers (new business models and lifestyle changes) can decrease future greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resource efficiency. The model framework captures the dynamic feedback loops between physical and economic systems and can assesse the trade-offs and synergies between different sustainability objectives.

A short description of the model can be find at https://wiki.circomod.eu/CIRCEE.

The source code of the model will be available here as soon as the model documentation is published (hopefully soon).
